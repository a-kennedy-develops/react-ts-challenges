This project serves as a practice ground for mastering common React and TypeScript coding challenges at various difficulty levels. I plan to enhance the app's styling and organization as more challenges are added.

# TODO

[ ] Add some advanced challenges
[ ] Style the pages to more aesthetically pleasing
- [X] Add minimal navbar styling
- [ ] Add better organization / styling for home page
- [ ] Add better organization / styling for challenge pages
[ ] Add toggleable code section for Challenge components, showcasing the code used for the solution

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 14.18+ or 20+) and npm (bundled with Node.js) or yarn (a package manager alternative) installed on your system. You can verify these by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone or download the project:**
   Use Git to clone the project from a remote repository or download the source code directly.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run either:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

   This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Start the development server:**
   Run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     yarn dev
     ```

   This will start the development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` by default (the exact port might vary slightly). You can then view the app in your web browser.

**Building for Production:**

Once you're ready to deploy your app in a production environment, you can create an optimized production build using:

   ```bash
   npm run build
