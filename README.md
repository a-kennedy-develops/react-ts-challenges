# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project serves as a practice ground for mastering common React and TypeScript coding challenges at various difficulty levels. As you progress, you'll enhance the app's styling and organization.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 14.18+ or 20+) and npm (bundled with Node.js) or yarn (a package manager alternative) installed on your system. You can verify these by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone or download the project:**
   Use Git to clone the project from a remote repository or download the source code directly.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run either:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

   This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Start the development server:**
   Run the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     yarn dev
     ```

   This will start the development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` by default (the exact port might vary slightly). You can then view the app in your web browser.

**Development:**

While the development server is running, any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser, speeding up your development workflow.

**Building for Production:**

Once you're ready to deploy your app in a production environment, you can create an optimized production build using:

   ```bash
   npm run build
